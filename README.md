1.	RESTful API Integration.
	
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for building web services, and RESTful APIs are often used to integrate different systems together. The RESTful API provides a way of communication between different applications over the internet.
Example Script:

Explanation:
First, we import the requests library, which allows us to send HTTP requests. We then use the get method to make a GET request to the URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1. This URL is a JSON API that returns a JSON object containing information about a particular to-do item.
We then print the JSON response using the json method, which converts the JSON data into a Python dictionary. This dictionary can then be used in our Python program.

MQTT Integration.

MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol that is often used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It provides a way of communication between different devices over the internet.
Example Script:

Explanation:
First, we import the paho-mqtt library, which provides a way of connecting to an MQTT broker and publishing messages to it. We then create a new instance of the mqtt.Client class, which will be used to connect to the MQTT broker.
We then use the connect method to connect to the MQTT broker at the host "broker.hivemq.com" on port 1883. This is a public MQTT broker that anyone can use for testing purposes.
Finally, we use the publish method to publish a message to the topic "test/topic". The message itself is the string "Hello, world!".

2.	Load Management.
To manage the load on the application, we can use load balancers and horizontal scaling. Load balancers distribute incoming requests to multiple servers, which can handle them in parallel. Horizontal scaling involves adding more server instances to handle the load, which works in conjunction with load balancers.
Example Technologies:
•	Nginx Load Balancer: It provides high performance, reliability, and flexibility for distributing traffic to backend servers.
•	Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): It is a popular cloud platform that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud.

Example Configuration:

To configure Nginx as a load balancer for multiple backend servers, follow these steps:
1.	Install Nginx on a separate server that will act as a load balancer.

2.	Edit the Nginx configuration file to specify the backend servers.

3.	Add the following configuration block to specify the backend servers.

2.	Asynchronous Service Management
To manage asynchronous services, we can use message queues and worker processes. Message queues provide a way of decoupling tasks from the main application, allowing for asynchronous processing. Worker processes can then be used to consume tasks from the queue and process them independently.
Example Technologies:
•	RabbitMQ: It is a popular message queue that provides reliable message delivery, routing, and flexibility for decoupling tasks from the main application.
•	Celery: It is a distributed task queue that provides asynchronous task processing, scheduling, and monitoring.
Example Configuration:
To configure RabbitMQ and Celery as a message queue and worker process respectively, follow these steps:
Install RabbitMQ on a separate server that will act as the message queue.

3.One-Way Hashing Methods:
	
a.SHA-256 Hashing:
SHA-256 is a cryptographic one-way hash function that produces a fixed-length 256-bit hash value from an input message. It is widely used for password storage and digital signatures.
Example Code:

b.bcrypt Hashing:
bcrypt is a cryptographic one-way hash function that is designed to be computationally expensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks. It is commonly used for password storage.
Example Code:

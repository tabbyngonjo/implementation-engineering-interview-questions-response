1.	RESTful API Integration.
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for building web services, and RESTful APIs are often used to integrate different systems together. The RESTful API provides a way of communication between different applications over the internet.

Explanation:
First, we import the requests library, which allows us to send HTTP requests. We then use the get method to make a GET request to the URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1. This URL is a JSON API that returns a JSON object containing information about a particular to-do item.
We then print the JSON response using the json method, which converts the JSON data into a Python dictionary. This dictionary can then be used in our Python program.

MQTT Integration.

MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol that is often used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It provides a way of communication between different devices over the internet.

Explanation:
First, we import the paho-mqtt library, which provides a way of connecting to an MQTT broker and publishing messages to it. We then create a new instance of the mqtt.Client class, which will be used to connect to the MQTT broker.
We then use the connect method to connect to the MQTT broker at the host "broker.hivemq.com" on port 1883. This is a public MQTT broker that anyone can use for testing purposes.
Finally, we use the publish method to publish a message to the topic "test/topic". The message itself is the string "Hello, world!".
